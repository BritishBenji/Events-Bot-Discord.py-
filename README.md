# Events Bot
 Bot to announce Discord Events and specific details (ie. Links, Room Codes, Usernames, etc.)
 
This bot was originally made for [James’ TØP Server](https://discord.gg/eGXDpKw) 
as a way to inform the server of how they can connect to different events.

This program is one that I hope to (in future) continue with to some extent and 
fully integrate it into server use.

To anyone that comes across this repository, please feel free to create an issue 
and leave suggestions! They are much appreciated!
